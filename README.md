## Alternative: Precompiled Binaries

If you prefer not to compile the source code yourself, precompiled binaries (currently only android available) are available. Simply download the binary from the [Releases](https://github.com/SwirX/soramai/releases) and install it to start using Soramai immediately.

## CLI Version

For users who prefer a command-line interface (CLI) experience, an alternative CLI program [AniWatch-CLI](https://github.com/SwirX/aniwatch-cli) is available. It provides 
similar functionality to Soramai but allows users to watch anime episodes directly from the terminal.
